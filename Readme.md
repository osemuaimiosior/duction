Duction is a permissioned distributed blockchain core banking platform.

A decentralized core enterprise ERP sysem:

Case study: At tek experts anytime there is a change to the central database infrastrueture other dependencies that used the db break, due to a central change...but in a distrubuted system, each nide still runs a copy of the prior data and its fornat, until there is a push from the change node then tat data and infrastures is passed doe to other nodes for them to functiin. 

no downtime, no errors, high avalibility.

Chain code dev: we can righ our vhain code in c so we can make use of system resouceses to optimize oir sustem. we would also add parallisation or ditributed system  or so.
